# Loan Data Analysis Project

This project explores a dataset of loan data to identify trends, patterns, and insights.

**Key findings:**

- The median interest rate for 60-month loans is higher than for 36-month loans.
- Most loans are concentrated towards the lower end of the loan amount range.
- A large majority of loans have been fully paid.
- Borrowers who own their homes tend to have higher annual incomes.
